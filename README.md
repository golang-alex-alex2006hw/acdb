# Amazon Cloud Drive credentials

Amazon Cloud Drive uses
[oAuth 2.0 for authentication](https://developer.amazon.com/public/apis/experience/cloud-drive/content/restful-api-getting-started).
The [token server](https://github.com/go-acd/token-server) takes care of
the oAuth authentication. For your convenience, an instance of the
server is deployed at:

https://go-acd.appspot.com

NOTE: this code service is not maintained by the author of this repo.  Use at
your own risk.  Better yet, deploy your own!
